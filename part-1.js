//Assignment 2-A Part 1
//Due Feb 12
//This short exercise will help you gain additional proficiency working with JavaScript objects


//Information about cities can be easily represented as JavaScript objects
var city1 = {
		name:"Boston",
		pop:657000,
		"year founded":1630
	};
var city2 = {
		name:"Cambridge",
		pop:120000,
		"year founded":1631
	};
	
//TODO: write a function that takes two city objects as parameter
//and returns the name of city that has a larger population
function whichCityIsLarger(a,b){
	//hint: since a and b are objects, you can access their "pop" property using a.pop
	//compare populations, and return the "name" property of the appropriate city

}
console.log( whichCityIsLarger(city1,city2) ); 


//TODO: write a function that returns the name of the city that is older
function whichCityIsOlder(a,b){
	//hint: more or less the same as above, but notice something weird about the property name "year founded"?
	//Can you still use the dot notation? If not, what should you do?
